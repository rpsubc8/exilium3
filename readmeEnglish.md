This diskmag was multiplatform (DOS, Windows, Linux, Beos and QNX). It had several other engines, like BSD and PSX, but in the end, it was released for those 5.<br>
The editor and coder of it is me (JJ, ackerman).<br>

After so many years, I am releasing the code, so that it can be looked at in an educational way or whatever you want, given that it is of little use today.<br>

If you only want to run, the data (sliders3.dat) was in the MSDOS distribution, having to copy the binaries for each OS to the same location.<br>

In issue 2 of Centolos'Becanne magazine we have an article dedicated to us:
En el número 2 de la revista Becanne de Centolos nos dedican un artículo:
